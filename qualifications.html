  <h1 class="section-title">Skills</h1>
  <p class="section-text">Most of my skills and projects revolve around automation, primarily with Python. During my past internship at <a class="link-inline" href="https://www.hpe.com/us/en/home.html">Hewlett Packard Enterprise</a>, I developed an automation toolkit for my team's CI pipeline using Python, which was integrated with various DevOps tools. While this is my area of focus, I also have experience in web development and app development.</p>
  <h1 class="section-title">Interests</h1>
  <p class="section-text">Due to my prior experience with Python, I am always eager to learn about new technologies and fields of interest within Python. I am currently looking into using Django and Flask to create full-stack web applications and REST APIs using Python. I have also recently taken an interest in systems engineering and low-level circuit design. While I am not very experienced in the field, I look forward to working on projects and teams as a systems engineer.</p>
